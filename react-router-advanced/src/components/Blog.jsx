        <h3>Dynamic Routing Demo</h3>
        <p>
          Notice how each blog post has a unique URL like <code>/blog/1</code>, <code>/blog/2</code>, etc. 
          This is achieved using dynamic routing with the <code>:postId</code> parameter in the route definition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Try manually typing different URLs like <code>/blog/3</code> or <code>/blog/999</code> to see how 
          the dynamic routing handles different post IDs.
